    /// <summary>@brief
    /// Minimum Viable Product focus on the essentials of a Maestro function. 
    /// Only a few functions are presented. Links to the documentation are provided for further exploration.
    /// Therefore, error tests are absent, the user interface is almost non-existent and manipulations in Unity are reduced. 
    /// 
    /// The goal is rather to learn how to use the Maestro API and then progress by building more complex applications.
    /// Maestro is based on the use of prefabs (MidiFilePlayer, MidiStreamPlayer, …) which must be added in the Unity editor in the hierarchy of your project.
    /// In these demos, we prefer to create the prefabs by script to avoid manipulations in the editor. 
    /// It is rather recommended to create Prefabs in Unity Editor to take advantage of the Inspectors and its many directly accessible parameters.
    /// 
    /// Demonstration:      Play a single C5 note when the space key is pressed, stop the note when the key is released.
    /// Implementation:     Add an empty gameobject in your Unity Scene then add this script to this gameobject.
    /// Running and using:  Play and stroke the space key, a C5 note will be played.
