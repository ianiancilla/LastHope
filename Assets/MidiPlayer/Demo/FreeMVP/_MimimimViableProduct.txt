A Minimum Viable Product has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product, and no more.
More detail here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product

Demonstration focus on the essentials of a Maestro function. 
Therefore, error tests are absent, the user interface is almost non-existent, and manipulations in Unity are reduced. 
The goal is rather to learn how to use the Maestro API and then progress by building more complex applications.

Maestro is based on the use of prefabs (MidiFilePlayer, MidiStreamPlayer, …) which must be added in the Unity editor in the hierarchy of your project.
In these demos, we prefer to create the prefabs by script to avoid manipulations in the editor. 
It is rather recommended to create them in Unity to take advantage of the Inspectors and its many directly accessible parameters.

We hope that could be a base for your own developments.
