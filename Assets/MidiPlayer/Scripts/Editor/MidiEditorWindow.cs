    /// MIDI Editor
    ///     Features:
    ///         Create a MIDI sequence from scratch.
    ///         Load a MIDI sequence from Maestro MIDI DB or an external MIDI file.
    ///         Save a MIDI sequence to Maestro MIDI DB or to an external MIDI file.
    ///         Keep current edition safe even when compiling or relaunching Unity editor (serialize/deserialize).
    ///         Display MIDI events by channel with a piano roll view
    ///         Create/Modify properties of notes and presets change.
    ///         Mouse editing functions: drag & drop event, change length.
    ///         Editing with quantization (whole, half, quarter, ...).
    ///         Integrated MIDI player, playing available when editing (but not when running).
    ///         Looping on the whole sequence or between two points.
    ///         Lean mode for looping at end (immediately, when all voices are released or when all voices are finished).
    ///         
    ///     New features and issues corrected 
    ///          -- 2.9.1 --
    ///         Current playing position(vertical red line) not drawn when playing if not following the MIDI events.
    ///         Key Enter/Return validate value entered for a MIDI event.
    ///          -- 2.10.0 --
    ///         Display measure according to the time signature.
    ///         With following mode, the horizontal scroll is not working, now following is disabled when scroll is move.
    ///         Enhance the time banner drawing.
    ///         Go to next or previous measure.
    ///         Draw the time banner with real time in relation of tempo change MIDI events.
    ///         Investigate why midiPlayerGlobal.InitInstance() takes time occasionally: sometime Unity take more time to load the samples. Nothing can be done.
    ///         Hide/show channel
    ///         Disable/enable playing by channel.
    ///         Add tempo event section for modification.
    ///         Add text event edition + others meta.
    ///         Integrate new Inner loop (enhance accuracy, based on tick value)
    ///         
    ///     Bugs to be corrected for the next version
    ///     
    ///     In progress:
    ///                  
    ///     Backlog by priority order:
    ///         Copy/paste event? multi events?
    ///         Merging classes AreaUI and SectionAll?
    ///         Undo/Redo.
    ///         Add velocity edition with Piano roll UI.
    ///         Add control change edition with Piano roll UI.
    ///         Playing and edtiting in run mode, feasability?
    ///         Redesign color and texture like MIDI event, keyboard ... 
    ///         Specific MIDI events for integration with Unity.
    ///         Multi events selection, feasability?
    ///         Helper for building chords.
    ///         Helper for scale.
    ///         Helper for chords progression?
    ///         Percussion library integrated in MIDI DB?
    ///         Add effects section.
    ///         Partial import/insert of MIDI: select channels, select tick. Example: import only drum from a lib.
    ///         Manage MIDI tracks, useful?
    ///         Resizable panel, like between piano and note, useful?
    ///         Rhythm generator with Euclidean algo.
    ///         Send MIDI events to an external MIDI keyboard + MIDI beat clock?
    ///         Add others meta event than text event for modification
